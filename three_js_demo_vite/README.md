# Three.js Demo with vite

For a better developer experience you should try the three.js demo with vite. All you have to do is navigate to this folder in your commandline and type `npm i`.

Afterwards use the command `npm run dev`. Vite will host your application on a random port. That way you can test your code comfortably in the browser.
